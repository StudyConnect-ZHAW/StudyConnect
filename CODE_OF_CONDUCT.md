# Code of Conduct

## Contact Person

- **Scrum Master:** Adrian Martinez
- **Frontend Team Lead:** Sumaya Mohat
- **Backend Team Lead:** Sebastian Fröhlicher
- **DevOps Team Lead:** Daniel Bucher

If you have questions, blockers, or issues, talk to the responsible person first. If the responsible person can't help, or you don't get a response within a reasonable time, escalate to Adrian.

### 1. Respect

- Be respectful in discussions.
- No interrupting, no personal attacks.
- Feedback should be objective and constructive.

### 2. Communication

- Keep it clear, direct, and on point.
- Bring up blockers early - do not wait until the last minute.
- Ask questions when you are stuck - someone probably knows the answer. You can always create an issue to write the question down.

### 3. Responsibility

- Own your tasks. If you can't deliver on time, let the team know ASAP.
- Document what you do so others can understand or pick up where you left off.
- Review code like you'd want yours reviewed - honest, respectful, and focused on improvement.

### 4. Meetings

- Show up on time. If you are held up or can't make it, let the team know on Teams or WhatsApp.
- Action points and tasks are written down in each meeting protocol, including deadlines. Meeting protocols are located in the Teams channel under [Documents/General/Files](https://zhaw.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/PM4-StudyConnect/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/Files?csf=1&web=1&e=CHFwAE).
- To keep meetings short and efficient, stick to the agenda. Detailed discussions about specific implementations should be handled within your team (Frontend/Backend) and with your team lead. Bring only important decisions and blockers back to the larger group when needed.

### 5. No Drama

- No insults, no passive-aggressive comments, no ghosting (e.g., ignoring messages or dropping tasks without communication).
- If something - whether it's a situation, task, or team dynamic - bring it up early and respectfully. Don't let things build up.
- If you're not comfortable addressing it directly, or if it's not getting resolved, talk to your team lead or Adrian (Scrum Master).

### 6. Inclusivity

- Everyone's voice counts. We are 8 people, and we all contribute.
- Feel free to voice concerns or bring up questions. Everyone will likely benefit — either by gaining a better understanding or by helping define a clearer direction for the project.

### 7. Use of LLMs and Tools

- You are allowed to use tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and so on to help you write code, documentation, or brainstorm solutions.
- **However**, if you commit code:
  * You must fully understand what it does.
  * You are responsible for ensuring it works as intended and does nothing more.
  * No blindly copying and pasting - review, test, and think!
- Security, data privacy, and performance are your responsibility when using auto-generated code.

### 8. Git and GitHub Etiquette

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- New code should be pushed into the `dev` branch before merging into `main`.
- Always create a new branch for your tasks from the `dev` branch.
- Group branches depending on their purpose, e.g. feature branches should have the `feature/` prefix, documentation branches should have the `doc/` prefix. This way they automatically get placed in a "folder".
- Pull requests should have the `PR: ` prefix, so it's easier to distinguish them in the project view.

If you’re ever unsure about anything — whether it’s a task, a process, or how we work as a team — just ask Adrian. It’s always better to clarify early than to be stuck or make assumptions.

We’re here to create an interesting and fun project, and good communication makes everything easier.
